## Getting Started

To run a local version of this project, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- docker & docker-compose

### Set up

1. Clone the repo into a **public** GitHub repository. If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with GNU GPLv3.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/zizdlp/zbook.git
    ```

2. Build & run your local development server

    ```shell
    make compose_pull
    ```

3. Then open the space in your web browser, using <http://localhost:3000/>

4. üçª To use email services and third-party account login, please apply first. For details, please refer to [ZBook User Guide](https://github.com/zizdlp/zbook-user-guide).

### CI and testing

All pull-requests will be tested against both visual and performances testing to prevent regressions.
ZBook is fully open-source and built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Features

Support:

- **full-stack**: a full-stack software utilizing Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Golang gRPC for backend services, PostgreSQL for database management, and MinIO for storage, and WebSocket for real-time messaging notifications.
- **multi-level permission management**: Support for various repository visibility options including public, login-only, selected users, and creator-only access.
- **Comments**
- **Notifications**
- **open source**

Not Support:

ZBook does **not support online editing**. We believe that tools like Git in local environments such as VS Code and Typora are sufficient for editing and collaborating on content. **Online editing is not essential** in our view. Additionally, enabling online editing would require granting write permissions to Git repositories, which could pose **security risks**.

## Deployment

For privacy and other reasons (for private repositories, you may need to input an access token; although GitHub supports fine-grained access tokens that can grant specific permissions to specific repositories, such as read-only), we encourage you to deploy ZBook yourself. You can use docker-compose or a k8s cluster for deployment. For details, please refer to the [ZBook User Guide](https://github.com/zizdlp/zbook-user-guide).

## License

Distributed under the [GNU GPLv3 License](https://github.com/zizdlp/zbook/LICENSE).

If you plan to distribute the code, you must the source code public to comply with GNU GPLv3.
See `LICENSE` for more information.
